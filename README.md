## HatClient recognizes Moderators and Admins

### This is an **EARLY DEMO**, some features do not work as intended.

## Features Coming Soon
### Custom Avatars
I plan to add the ability to upload an image for your custom avatar, that will be shown beside your name. (To anyone using the latest version of HatClient)
There are a few implemented as tests:<br><br>

### Easy Switching Between Rooms/Forks
Also coming soon, I plan to add a 'tab-system' to switch between multiple rooms or servers without having to leave the client!<br>In theory, you'll be able to seamlessly switch between rooms without ever disconnecting!<br>(no image)<br>

### Multiple Themes
HatClient currently has support for some themes which change colors and more, but it will soon have over 15 different themes. Perfect for any user!<br>The current themes available for HatClient include:<br>
* Default (The default, white backround and black text theme)
* Dark (Dark background, grey text)
* Solarized (Uh.. the default you see on ToastyChat)<br>
(Screenshots coming soon)

### Built-in Emoji Menu
HatClient will soon have an emoji menu, which will allow you to select an emoji to be added into your message. These will be unicode emojis. Some support for this currently exists, but it doesn't like to work properly, so it may be added in the future.

## Contributors/Credits
- Thanks to [@marzavec](https://github.com/marzavec) for adding auto-scroll, and motivating me (eh, sorta?)

## Adding a Server/Fork to HatClient
