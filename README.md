### This is an **EARLY DEMO**, some features do not work as intended.

## Features Coming Soon
### Custom Avatars
I plan to add the ability to upload an image for your custom avatar, that will be shown beside your name. (To anyone using the latest version of HatClient)
There are a few implemented as tests:<br><br>

### Easy Switching Between Rooms/Forks
Also coming soon, I plan to add a 'tab-system' to switch between multiple rooms or servers without having to leave the client!<br>In theory, you'll be able to seamlessly switch between rooms without ever disconnecting!<br>(no image)<br>

- Thanks to [@marzavec](https://github.com/marzavec) for adding auto-scroll, and motivating me

========
There are a few built-in commands for HatClient

## Adding a Server/Fork to HatClient
#### (I plan to automate this in the future)
Adding your own fork to the list requires a few steps.<br><br>
